# BC5_GroupE - Cryptocurrency Data Visualization

**Small change to app.py on the 31st May:** Due to yfinance lack of data regarding the last 2 days, the Dash Table indexes needed to be fixed, in order to display the available data.


This dashboard was built for an academic project, and its purpose is to showcase crypto value fluctuations and serve as a tool for interpreting their behavior, by illustrating important aspects that might impact it, as well as hourly and daily predictions for the closing price. Plotly and Dash were the tools chosen to construct this visual solution. Real-time data is retrieved from Yahoo Finance and Financial Modeling Prep, through APIs.

This code was deployed using Heroku, and the final result can be consulted [here](https://bc5groupe.herokuapp.com/).

To run it on a personal machine: install all libraries present in the requirements.txt and run app.py with Pycharm or other compatible IDE. The outcome will be shown in a webpage.

Preview of final results, taken May 30th 2022:
